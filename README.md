## About the project
Power BI Dashboard on Prime Video Dataset
I recently created an interactive dashboard in Power BI using the Prime Video dataset from Kaggle.

The dashboard provides insights such as:
🎬 Distribution of Movies vs. TV Shows
🌍 Content availability across different countries
⭐ Ratings breakdown to see which categories are most popular
⏳ Trends by release year and duration analysis
🎭 Genre-based distribution to understand the variety of content

Through this project, I got hands-on experience in:
 ✅ Data cleaning & preprocessing
 ✅ Power Query transformations
 ✅ Using DAX for calculations
 ✅ Designing visual storytelling with charts

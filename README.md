## About the project
Power BI Dashboard on Prime Video Dataset
I recently created an interactive dashboard in Power BI using the Prime Video dataset from Kaggle.

##### The dashboard provides insights such as: 
•	Distribution of Movies vs. TV Shows
•	 Content availability across different countries
•	 Ratings breakdown to see which categories are most popular
•	 Trends by release year and duration analysis
•	 Genre-based distribution to understand the variety of content

##### Through this project, I got hands-on experience in: 
•	 Data cleaning & preprocessing
•	 Power Query transformations
•	 Using DAX for calculations
•	 Designing visual storytelling with charts
